- [Entities](docs/architecture/entities.md)
- [Flows](docs/architecture/flows.md)
- [Storage](docs/architecture/storage.md)
- [Containers & Networking](docs/architecture/containers.md)
- [Execution algorithms](docs/architecture/algorithms.md)

## How to use these docs

- Start with **Flows** to understand who calls whom.
- Then read **Storage** to understand what is persisted where.
- Then use **Execution algorithms** as the implementation contract.

For UX-level requirements, see `docs/product/tz-client-journey.md`.
